		<p>An optional, wrapping element that may be utilized to encode formatting features that are

		<!--It seems like we're encoding for display here, so perhaps we should go with an automated Schema-to-TEI approach at some point, rather than keeping these files in sync by hand moving forward
		...especially with EAF, etc. Yikes! -->
		<!-- rather that sort A-Z in one list, would it be better to break out by type?  e.g. narrative appearance vs. findingAidDesc vs. former dsc + new formAvailable ? -->
		<!-- also, in this case, i think we should take a harder line and *only* allow this extension on narrative elements, but also to be more flexible and allow it to sit side-by-side with paragraphs. i can certainly see the benefit of having a formattingExtension follow a local set of "paragraphs". -->

		<p><gi>formattingExtension</gi> provides the option to embed external namespaces directly within the source file, when complex formatting is required. It should preferably be used for embedding XHTML data.</p>

		<p>Optional. Only repeatable within the context of <gi>findAidDesc</gi>.</p>

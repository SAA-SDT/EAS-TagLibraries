		<!-- also, in this case, i think we should take a harder line and *only* allow this extension on narrative elements, but also to be more flexible and allow it to sit side-by-side with paragraphs. i can certainly see the benefit of having a formattingExtension follow a local set of "paragraphs". -->

						The Spanish governor of the Louisiana Territory (which encompassed 13 present states), Bernardo de Gálvez is an unsung hero who greatly contributed to the winning of the American Revolution. General Gálvez launched brilliant campaigns against the British in Louisiana and West Florida by organizing a military force of regular troops, militia, volunteers, and a few Americans. His victories during the revolution contributed significantly to the struggle for American independence because he prevented the British from gaining access to the strategically located Mississippi River Valley. The city of Galveston, Texas, is named in honor of his contributions during the American Revolution, and he is honored on a 15-cent stamp.

                  <p>The current drafting status of the EAS instance.</p>

               <div type="description">
                  <p>The maintenance status must occur on <gi>control</gi>. As an EAS instance
                     is modified or other events happen to it (as recorded in the
                        <gi>maintenanceHistory</gi> element), the maintenance status should also be
                     updated to reflect the current drafting status.</p>
                  <p>On first creation the status would be "new", which on revision can be changed
                     to "revised". Because it is important to be clear about what has happened to
                     records, particularly when sharing and making links between them, a number of
                     status values are available for records that are no longer current. A record
                     that is simply deleted from a system can be given the status "deleted", but in
                     cases where a record is marked as not current (obsolete or rejected) but kept
                     for reference then it should be given the status "cancelled". If a record is
                     deleted because it has become superseded by two or more records then its status
                     should be given as "deletedSplit", while if it has simply been replaced by a
                     new record then "deletedReplaced" is the appropriate status value. If a record
                     is deleted because it has been merged with another record, its status should be
                     given as "deletedMerged". A "derived" status value is available to indicate
                     that the record was derived from another descriptive system.</p>

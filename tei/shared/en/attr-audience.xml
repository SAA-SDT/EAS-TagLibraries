                  <p>An optional attribute that helps control whether the information contained in the
                     element should be available to all viewers or only to repository staff.

                  <p>Available as global attribute for all elements. The attribute can be set to
                     "external" in <gi>cpfDescription</gi> to allow access to all the information
                     about the entity being described, but specific elements within
                     <gi>cpfDescription</gi> can also be set to "internal" to reserve that information
                     for repository access only. This feature is intended to assist application
                     software in restricting access to particular information by explicitly
                     identifying data that is potentially sensitive or may otherwise have a limited
                     audience. Special software capability may be needed, however, to prevent the
                     display or export of an element marked "internal" when a whole EAC-CPF instance is
                     displayed in a networked environment.</p>

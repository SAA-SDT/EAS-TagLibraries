                  <p>Available as global attribute for all elements. The attribute can be set to "external" in e.g. cpfDescription in EAC-CPF or <gi>archDesc</gi> in EAD to allow access to all the information about the entity resp. the materials being described, but specific elements within these sections can also be set to "internal" to reserve that information for repository access only. This feature is intended to assist application software in restricting access to particular information by explicitly identifying data that is potentially sensitive or may otherwise have a limited audience. Special software capability may be needed, however, to prevent the display or export of an element marked "internal" when a whole EAS instance is displayed in a networked environment.</p>
                 <!-- Note: the following paragraph will apply to all EAS in future, assuming that EAC-CPF will follow the approach of removing predefined values from attributes and setting the attributes' encoding within the <control> element. -->
                 <p>Use the attribute <att>audienceEncoding</att> in <gi>control</gi> to identify the list of terms to be used as values of <att>audience</att>.</p>

                        <ead:p>The records of the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment came to the Institute Archives in two accessions in 1980 and 1982. During processing the collection was reduced from fifteen cubic feet to
                           four by discarding duplicate materials, financial records, and publications not authored by MODE participants. Forty charts and six inches of raw data presented the primary appraisal issues.
                           The raw data consisted of bulletins and reports referring to float positions, moorings, isotherms, geostrophic velocity calculations, ships' summaries, and work proposed and work carried out
                           during the MODE-I experiment. As this raw data was recapitulated in weekly <ead:title render="underline">

                           provided.</ead:p>
                        <ead:p>Six inches of materials pertaining to the POLYMODE project, 1973-1980, were added to the Institute Archives POLYMODE collection.</ead:p>
                        <ead:p>The appraisal of this collection was carried out in consultation with Robert Heinmiller, a research associate at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution during MODE.</ead:p>

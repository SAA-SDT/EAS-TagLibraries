               <head>Preface</head>
               <p>Encoded Archival Description (EAD) is the international metadata transmission standard for hierarchical descriptions of archival records. Developed by the EAD Working Group of the Society of American
                  Archivists and first published in 1998, EAD is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format used by archivists around the globe. A second version with greater international alignment, EAD 2002, was
                  released as a DTD in 2002 and in 2007 as Relax NG and W3C schemas. The development of EAD made it possible to create electronic finding aids within a specifically archival data structure compliant with
                  General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)). This innovation was a crucial impetus behind the swift migration of archival description to the internet, the acceptance of national
                  archival descriptive content standards like Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), and the emergence of a professional consensus that archival description existed to be shared widely and shared
                  well.</p>
               <p>This new version of Encoded Archival Description – EAD3 – exists thanks to the efforts and support of many people, but it exists because of the many archivists and repositories around the world that saw
                  the utility of EAD, used it in diverse and inspiring ways, and continue to recognize many ways in which it might work better. </p>
               <p>In the years between the release of EAD 2002 and 2010, when the revision process that led to EAD3 began, the technological landscape surrounding archival description evolved enormously. Collection
                  management systems, such as the Archivists’ Toolkit, Archon, and ICA-AtoM, offered the robust advantages of modelling descriptive information in relational databases, but exposed the difficulty of
                  adapting the EAD document model in data-centric applications. Linked Open Data emerged as a viable methodology for creating a semantically meaningful Web, for which EAD was poorly prepared. New and
                  closely related metadata transmission standards were developed, most notably Encoded Archival Context – Corporate bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF), opening new frontiers in archival metadata.
                  Finally, over a decade of working with EAD gave archivists a general sense that it was too complex, too forgiving, and too flexible for its own good.</p>
               <p>In 2010, following an update to its by-laws concerning standards maintenance, the SAA Standards Committee charged a new Technical Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Description (TS-EAD) to oversee the
                  maintenance of the standard. Recognizing that EAD needed an update, its charge instructed TS-EAD to complete a revision of the standard within five years. </p>
               <p>TS-EAD completed the revision of EAD with the help of the SAA Schema Development Team and with many contributions, large and small, from the international EAD community. EAD3 is the result of four
                  public comment periods, countless feedback, three working meetings, numerous conference calls, regular presentations to the EAD Roundtable, and lots of careful analysis, spirited discussion, and
                  hard-won compromise. Notable milestones in the revision process include the initial comment period, which shaped our early agenda; a three-day TS-EAD working meeting at Yale University’s Beinecke Rare
                  Book and Manuscript Library, which established a clear direction; and the alpha, beta, and gamma schema releases, which gave the EAD community concrete examples to test and critique. </p>
               <p>Early in the revision process TS-EAD published four points of emphasis to guide us as we weighed the benefits of changes to EAD. </p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item>Achieving greater conceptual and semantic consistency in the use of EAD.</item>
                  <item>Exploring mechanisms whereby EAD-encoded information might more seamlessly and effectively connect with, exchange, or incorporate data maintained according to other protocols.</item>
                  <item>Improving the functionality of EAD for representing descriptive information created in international and particularly in multilingual environments.</item>
                  <item>Being mindful that a new version will affect current users.</item>
               </list>
               <p>All of the changes made in EAD3 can be seen in the context of these four points. Throughout the revision process, the most difficult decisions concerned proposals that highlighted tensions between them,
                  especially between making EAD more consistent and aligned to other standards and mitigating impact on current users.</p>
               <p>TS-EAD’s decision-making process focused on detailed analysis and consensus-building within the committee. As we received proposals from the community or fellow committee members, individuals or small
                  groups did additional work to better understand the request, clarify the specific impact on the schema, and make recommendations to the committee. Many issues were revisited multiple times as we
                  collectively came to understand better our goals and their impact. Although healthy differences of opinion persisted throughout the revision process, ultimately only one issue had to be decided by an
                  executive decision by the co-chairs. In the alpha schema element and attribute names were converted to camel case, as is the convention in EAC-CPF. This met our goals of conceptual consistency and
                  interoperability with EAC-CPF, but we received strong feedback from the community arguing against the change. Entrenched and opposing opinions – all with strong justifications from our points of
                  emphasis – remained within TS-EAD; ultimately the co-chairs decided to honor precedent and sensitivity to the impact on users and opted to remove camel case.</p>
               <p>Of the changes made in EAD3, the most extensive departure from EAD 2002 is the replacement of <gi>eadheader</gi> with <gi>control</gi>. Borrowed from EAC-CPF with some enhancements, <gi>control</gi>
                  offers a better model for representing information about finding aids, including its identifiers, status, languages, conventions, maintenance history, and sources. One notable change to <gi>control</gi>
                  as modelled in EAC-CPF is the inclusion of <gi>filedesc</gi> from <gi>eadheader</gi>. As an aggregation of descriptions of all the material in an archival collection, finding aids have bibliographic
                  attributes, such as a title or a publication statement captured in <gi>filedesc</gi>, that are not necessary when documenting authority records.</p>
               <p>The elements available within <gi>did</gi> (Descriptive Identification) were extensively updated in order to better support the exchange of key descriptive data between EAD3 and other systems. Some
                     <gi>did</gi> elements, including <gi>origination</gi>, <gi>repository</gi>, and <gi>langmaterial</gi>, were modified to remove mixed content and other ambiguities. The existing <gi>unitdate</gi> and
                     <gi>physdesc</gi> elements were felt to be too lax to constrain and still provide a forward migration path, so new <gi>unitdatestructured</gi> and <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements were added.
                  These "structured" elements provide nuanced data models for capturing temporal and physical description, while the original elements remain in modified form as unstructured alternatives and to allow for
                  forward migration from EAD 2002. Whereas these new elements provided additional structure, the <gi>daogrp</gi> element, which allowed the creation of extended links to digital archival objects, was
                  simplified to <gi>daoset</gi>, which binds two or more simple <gi>dao</gi> elements.</p>
               <p>The access point elements available within <gi>controlaccess</gi>, e.g. <gi>persname</gi>, <gi>subject</gi>, <gi>genreform</gi>, etc., were modified in several ways. Each must now contain one or more
                     <gi>part</gi> elements so that multi-part terms may be accurately represented in EAD, allowing, for example, the separate capture of an individual’s surname, forename, and life dates, etc. They also
                  now share a common set of attributes to improve interoperability with external vocabularies: <att>identifier</att>, for the code or URI associated with a term, <att>source</att>, for identifying the
                  originating vocabulary, and <att>rules</att>, for recording how terms are formulated. The <gi>geogname</gi> element now has an optional child <gi>geographiccoordinates</gi> for encoding longitude,
                  latitude, and altitude information.</p>
               <p>Support for multilingual description was addressed by adding <att>lang</att> and <att>script</att> attributes to all non-empty elements in EAD3, making it possible to explicitly state what language or
                  script is used therein. Additionally, some elements were modified to allow them to repeat where previously they did not, thus enabling the inclusion of the same data in multiple languages.</p>
               <p>Early in the revision process there were multiple requests to simplify EAD, and one suggested measure was reducing the number of elements. However, TS-EAD decided that consistency and semantic clarity
                  was a better measure of simplicity, not the number of elements in the schema. The <gi>note</gi> element is a useful case study. In EAD 2002 <gi>note</gi> was available in 8 distinct contexts, each
                  representing a subtly different usage; in EAD3 the <gi>note</gi> element has been replaced with context-specific elements, including <gi>didnote</gi>, <gi>controlnote</gi>, and <gi>footnote</gi>.</p>
               <p>Many other changes can be categorized as supporting the drive for greater conceptual and sematic consistency in EAD. Major descriptive elements that previously could be contained in other descriptive
                  elements were removed in those contexts. For example, <gi>arrangement</gi> is no longer a permitted child of <gi>scopecontent</gi>, <gi>unitdate</gi> is no longer a permitted child of
                  <gi>unittitle</gi>, and <gi>dao</gi> is now only available within <gi>did</gi>. Block and formatting elements like <gi>list</gi>, <gi>blockquote</gi>, <gi>quote</gi>, were modified or created to more
                  closely resemble their HTML counterparts. The <gi>chronlist</gi> element was updated to incorporate <gi>geogname</gi> to convey the locations where events occur, more closely aligning it with its
                  namesake in EAC-CPF. Mixed content models were streamlined to three progressively inclusive sets of elements allowed to intermix with text. Attribute names were disambiguated throughout the schema:
                     <att>role</att> was changed to <att>relator</att> on access point elements and <att>linkrole</att> on linking elements, <att>type</att> was renamed through the schema to <att>localtype</att> where no
                  values are supplied by the schema, and to @elementnametype (e.g. <att>listtype</att> and <att>unitdatetype</att>) where specified values are supplied. Linking elements – of which there were many in EAD
                  2002 – were consolidated to a handful and limited to simple links, eliminating overly complicated extended links. The XLink model for linking attributes was preserved, but the XLink namespace, which had
                  been added to the schema versions of EAD 2002, was removed due to the onerous and needless complexity that namespaces introduce when processing XML. Elements that existed solely to support formatting
                  and presentation or were otherwise deemed out of scope for archival description were deprecated, including <gi>frontmatter</gi>, <gi>descgrp</gi>, <gi>runner</gi>, <gi>imprint</gi>, and
                     <gi>bibseries</gi>. </p>
               <p>The feature of EAD3 that caused the most heated discussion within TS-EAD was the inclusion of the <gi>relations</gi> element. Introduced in EAC-CPF and added to EAD3 with some modifications,
                     <gi>relations</gi> is available at any level of description and contains one or more <gi>relation</gi> elements. A <gi>relation</gi> describes – in a Linked Open Data-friendly way – the relationship
                  between the records being described and a corporate body, person or family; an archival or bibliographic resource; a function; or another type of external entity. That relationship can be an actionable
                  link and may be qualified by supplying relevant dates or geographic names. XML describing the related entity may be embedded within the <gi>objectxmlwrap</gi> element.</p>
               <p>TS-EAD could not reach a consensus regarding the inclusion of <gi>relations</gi>. Some members felt strongly that including <gi>relations</gi> was essential in order to support rich Linked Open Data
                  applications, align with EAC-CPF, and acknowledge draft guidelines on relationships in archival description published by the ICA Committee on Best Practices and Standards. Others felt that it duplicated
                  functionality present in <gi>controlaccess</gi> and other existing elements, added unnecessary complexity, and that incorporating robust support for Linked Open Data was premature. We ultimately
                  negotiated a compromise: <gi>relations</gi> would be included in EAD3 as an "experimental" element. As an experimental element, it is not guaranteed that <gi>relations</gi> will persist in the next
                  version of EAD in its current form. However, TS-EAD encourages its use so that the EAD community will learn more about how the <gi>relations</gi> model works within archival description. Put simply, a
                  consensus will require more data and experience, and including <gi>relations</gi> provisionally makes that possible.</p>
               <p>The revision of EAD 1.0 to EAD 2002 established a precedent that elements to be removed from EAD would first be deprecated – suppressed but available if necessary – before being removed from subsequent
                  versions. All elements deprecated in EAD 2002 were removed from EAD3. TS-EAD endeavored to honor the commitment to deprecate removed elements, however the extent of the changes in EAD3 made
                  comprehensive deprecation impossible. Elements to be removed entirely from the standard remain available in undeprecated versions of EAD3. These include <gi>frontmatter</gi>, <gi>descgrp</gi>,
                     <gi>imprint</gi>, <gi>bibseries</gi>, and <gi>runner</gi>, as well as the <att>tpattern</att> attribute. Elements that were replaced by other elements offering commensurate functionality, or whose
                  availability within the standard changed are in most cases not supported in undeprecated EAD3. Two exceptions to that rule are the full EAD 2002 versions of <gi>physdesc</gi> and <gi>unitdate</gi>
                  within <gi>unittitle</gi>, both of which are available in undeprecated EAD3.</p>
               <p>EAD3 replaces EAD 2002 as the current, official version of EAD. EAD 2002 was available as a DTD, Relax NG schema, and W3C schema. Additionally, the DTD could be edited to enable the inclusion of
                  deprecated elements. EAD3 continues to be available in DTD, Relax NG, and W3C versions. For repositories who choose to continue to use deprecated elements, an undeprecated version of EAD3 is available
                  in DTD, Relax NG, and W3C varieties. Due to differences between DTDs and schemas, the <gi>objectxmlwrap</gi> element is not available in the DTD versions of EAD3. A Schematron schema is also available
                  to provide further validation functionality for EAD instances, imposing data constraints that either cannot be expressed in DTD, Relax NG, and W3C, or were intentionally removed from the schemas by
                  TS-EAD due to challenges of maintaining code lists outside of our control or to allow alternative data sources or patterns.</p>
               <p>All code related to EAD3, including the schemas and DTDs, Schematron schema, and migration style sheet, will be shared with a Creative Commons CC0 license, placing them in the public domain. This tag
                  library is published with a Creative Commons CC BY license, allowing others to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they credit SAA for the original tag

               <p>EAD3 was possible because of the generous support of the Society of American Archivists, the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Nationaal Archief of the
                  Netherlands, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, and OCLC Research. Each member of TS-EAD* made
                  invaluable contributions to EAD3, but two merit special mention: Terry Catapano, Schema Development Team chair, for leading the technical development of EAD3, and Kelcy Shepherd, for leading the
                  revision of the Tag Library.</p>

               <p>EAD3 underwent its first revision from 2018 January 16 to 2018 February 28 in order to address schema errors and expand the standard's element set. This revision consisted of seven changes - one new
                  element (rightsdeclaration), two schema bugfixes, and four datatype/attribute extensions. These changes reflect feedback on the EAD3 1.0.0 release and accomodate requirements for data sharing set forth
                  by consortial members.</p>
               <p>EAD3 Revision 1.1.0 sets a new policy for schema releases, in which smaller updates and fixes can be released on a regular basis. These changes will not invalidate existing records, nor will it break
                  existing interoperability - minor revisions will only be expansive.</p>
               <p>This update was revised and implemented by the SAA Technical Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Standards (TS-EAS), following a period of feedback in January-February 2018.</p>

               <list type="gloss">
                  <label>Tag Name: </label>
                  <item>Short, mnemonic form of the element name that is used in the machine-readable encoded document. The tag name is the first word at the top of the page. Tag names appear between angle brackets,
                     e.g., <gi>archdesc</gi>, except in the listings under "May occur within" and "May contain," and are always in lowercase.</item>
                  <label>Element Name:</label>
                  <item>Expanded version of the tag name that more fully describes the element's meaning. The full name of the element is usually a word or phrase that identifies the element's purpose. In the Tag
                     Library, the element name follows the tag name on the page defining that element and appears with initial capital letters, e.g., <gi>archdesc</gi> Archival Description.</item>
                  <label>Summary:</label>
                  <item>A brief statement that provides a concise definition of the element, suitable for quick reference.</item>
                  <label>May Contain:</label>
                  <item>Identifies what child nodes (text or elements) may occur within the element being defined. Elements are listed in alphabetical order by tag name. Elements may be empty (e.g., an element which
                     allows no child text or element nodes), or they may contain text (listed as [text]), other elements, or a mixture of text and other elements.<lb/>Text content cannot include characters that would be
                     interpreted by a parser as action codes. For example, a left angle bracket has to be represented as the character entity reference &amp;lt; so that it is not misinterpreted as the start of an element
                     name. </item>
                  <label>May Occur Within:</label>
                  <item>Identifies all of the parent elements within which the described element may appear, listed in alphabetical order by tag name. This information conveys information about where and how often an
                     element is available throughout the schema. The definitions for parent elements may provide additional information about an element's usage.</item>
                  <label>Attributes:</label>
                  <item>Identifies all attributes that can be associated with an element. Attributes are represented in lowercase letters in XML coding. The Tag Library uses the convention of preceding an attribute name
                     with an @ symbol (e.g., <att>identifier</att>), following XPath syntax. See the EAD Attributes section of the tag library for definitions and additional information.</item>
                  <label>Description and Usage:</label>
                  <item>This section begins with one or more paragraphs that provide a more thorough description of the element than that found in the Summary, which may be followed by guidance on use. The terms "parent"
                     and "child" are used to indicate hierarchical relationships between elements. Standard terminology is also used to suggest the kind of element being discussed. "Wrapper element" indicates an element
                     that cannot contain text directly; a second, nested element must be opened first. Wrapper elements designate sets of elements that comprise a distinctive section of a finding aid, for example, the
                     Descriptive Identification <gi>did</gi>. "Generic element" refers to elements common to many kinds of documents that contain information not specifically related to archival description, e.g.,
                        <gi>name</gi> and <gi>num</gi>. "Formatting element" indicates elements that can be used to invoke special text presentation, such as block quotes, chronologies, and emphasis. When the schema
                     enforces a specific sequence of child elements, that sequence is indicated.<lb/>If useful, context-specific guidance for the usage of an element’s attributes is given in an "Attribute usage" section.
                     A "See also" section may be provided to indicate additional elements that are similar, easily confused, or otherwise related to the element being described.</item>
                  <label>Availability:</label>
                  <item>Indicates, within the context of its parent(s), whether the element is required or optional, and whether or not it is repeatable. </item>
                  <label>References:</label>
                  <item>Identifies corresponding elements in other standards, schemas, and markup languages: ISAD(G), MARC, MODS, and HTML. Full crosswalks for ISAD(G), MARC21, and MODS are found in Appendix A. </item>
                  <label>Examples:</label>
                  <item>Most element descriptions include a tagged example to indicate how attributes and elements can be used together. Many of the examples are taken from real finding aids; others have been specially
                     constructed for the Tag Library. The examples illustrate any required sequences of elements, as in the case of children within <gi>control</gi>, or required attributes such as <att>level</att> in
                        <gi>archdesc</gi>. In other cases, the examples simply show what is possible. Some examples have ellipses, either between or within elements, indicating that other elements or text have been
                     omitted. Some elements have multiple examples—one may show very dense markup with numerous attributes while another may illustrate a minimalist approach to the markup. Either approach is valid in
                     EAD, and it is up to the repository to determine the optimal level of markup based on their specific purposes, functional requirements, resources, or consortial guidelines.</item>

               <p>Attributes are associated with most of the elements contained in EAD. Attributes reflect named properties of an element and may take on different values, depending on the context in which they occur. In
                  order to set one or more attributes, an encoder should include the name of the attribute(s) within the same angle brackets as the start tag, together with the value(s) to which the attribute(s) is/are
                  to be set. That is,<lb/>
                  <code>&lt;[tag] [attribute]="[value]"&gt;</code>
                  <lb/> or<lb/>
                  <code>&lt;[tag] [attribute1]="[value1]" [attribute2]="[value2]"&gt;</code>
               </p>
               <p>For example: <lb/>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="eng" valid="true">
                     <ead:unitdate unitdatetype="inclusive">1937-1992</ead:unitdate>
                  </egXML>
                  <lb/> or<lb/>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="eng" valid="true">
                     <ead:unitdate unitdatetype="inclusive" normal="1937/1992">1937-1992 </ead:unitdate>
                  </egXML>
               </p>
               <p>Most attributes are optional, though some are required. The attribute description indicates whether an attribute is required. This information is also available in the Attributes section of each element
                  description.</p>
               <p>The value of attributes may be constrained by the schema using specific attribute type values. For example, <att>id</att> attribute is of type ID, which constrains its value to a string beginning with
                  an alphabetic character. An <att>id</att> value must be unique within the EAD instance within which it occurs, that is, no other tag in the entire document can have the same <att>id</att> value. EAD
                  attributes have the following data types <note>(capitalization of data types follows the documentation found in the W3C Recommendation <title>XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</title> (<ref
                        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/</ref>)</note>:</p>
               <list type="gloss">
                  <label>anyURI:</label>
                  <item>A Uniform Resource Identifier. This may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN). Both relative and absolute URIs are allowed.</item>
                  <label>ENTITY:</label>
                  <item>The name of a nonparsed entity that has been declared in the declaration subset of the document. For example, <att>entityref</att> must contain the name of an entity that has been declared in the
                     declaration subset. Processing software can use the reference to the nonparsed entity to display the entity in the body of the text or in a new window.</item>
                  <label>ID:</label>
                  <item>Unique identifier. For example, most elements have an <att>id</att>, so that a unique code can be established for and used to refer to that specific element. The content of the <att>id</att> is of
                     the type called "ID". Parsers verify that the value of attributes of type "ID" are unique. The values of <att>id</att> must begin with an alpha, not numeric, character, either upper or lowercase, and
                     may contain a . (period), : (colon), - (hyphen), or _ (underscore), but not a blank space. See also attributes of type "IDREF."</item>
                  <label>IDREF:</label>
                  <item>ID reference value; must match an existing ID of another element in the document. For example, the <gi>ptr</gi> element has a <att>target</att> attribute that can only be an "IDREF," which means
                     it has to reference a valid ID in another element.</item>
                  <label>IDREFS:</label>
                  <item>List of ID reference values.</item>
                  <label>NMTOKEN:</label>
                  <item>A name token, which can consist of any alpha or numeric character, as well as a . (period), : (colon), - (hyphen), or _ (underscore), but not a blank space. A number of attributes in EAD where a
                     character string from a code list is to be used are of the type "NMTOKEN".</item>
                  <label>string:</label>
                  <item>The most general data type, a string can contain any sequence of characters allowed in XML. Certain characters may have to be represented with an entity reference, for example &amp;lt; for &lt;,
                     and &amp;amp; for &amp;.</item>
                  <label>token:</label>
                  <item>A type of string that may not contain carriage return, line feed or tab characters, leading or trailing spaces, and any internal sequence of two or more spaces.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The attribute value definitions in the DTD versions of EAD3 differ slightly from those of the Relax NG and W3C Schema versions. The DTD has a limited set of attribute types so the anyURI, token, and
                  string data types were converted to "CDATA" (i.e. Character Data).</p>
               <p>When the EAD schema limits attribute values to a few choices, those values are declared in the schema in what is known as a "closed list." For example, the values of <att>audience</att> are limited to
                  either "external" or "internal." Other attributes are associated with semi-closed lists. Such lists include those values believed to be the most useful in many contexts, but other values are allowed.
                  For example, <gi>dsc</gi> defines several values for <att>dsctype</att>, including "otherdsctype" which may be used with <att>otherdsctype</att> to specify values that are not in the semi-closed list
                  for <att>dsctype</att>. The definitions for some values in the closed and semi-closed lists appear below.</p>
               <p>The following is a complete list of all the attributes that occur in EAD, and some discussion of how they may be used. Further, context-specific information about the use of certain attributes may be
                  found in the "Attribute usage" section of the element descriptions.</p>

                              and 1879 by Egan. The other maps are undated and unsigned but it is likely that he drew them during these years. These maps primarily depict subdivisions of non-rancho tracts of land
                              occupying what is now Orange County, with the addition of some topographical details. </ead:abstract>

                        <ead:p>The records of the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment came to the Institute Archives in two accessions in 1980 and 1982. During processing the collection was reduced from fifteen cubic feet to
                           four by discarding duplicate materials, financial records, and publications not authored by MODE participants. Forty charts and six inches of raw data presented the primary appraisal issues.
                           The raw data consisted of bulletins and reports referring to float positions, moorings, isotherms, geostrophic velocity calculations, ships' summaries, and work proposed and work carried out
                           during the MODE-I experiment. As this raw data was recapitulated in weekly <ead:title render="underline">

                        <ead:p>As the size of the Yale faculty increased, Brewster's new admissions policies caused the make up of the undergraduate body to shift. By the early 1960s, most undergraduates had prepared at
                           private schools, and many were sons of Yale alumni. As with the faculty, Brewster felt that Yale was consistently overlooking some of the best intellectual student talent necessary to maintain
                           the highest levels of academic excellence. In a 1965 speech to alumni, Brewster summarized his administration's revised recruitment policy by stating that Yale would only seek students</ead:p>

                  <p>As a wrapper for a set of elements, <gi>c</gi> provides information about the content, context, and extent of a subordinate body of materials. It is always a child or descendant of <gi>dsc</gi> and
                     often a child and/or parent of another <gi>c</gi>. Each <gi>c</gi> identifies a logical section, or level, of the described materials. The physical filing separations between components need not
                     always coincide with the intellectual separations. For example, a <gi>c</gi> that designates dramatic works might end in the same box in which the next <gi>c</gi> begins with short stories. Also, not
                     every <gi>c</gi> directly corresponds to a folder or other physical entity. Some <gi>c</gi> elements simply represent a logical point in a hierarchical description.</p>
                  <p>Components may be subdivided into smaller and smaller components and may eventually reach the level of a single item. For example, the components of a collection may be a series, components of series
                     may be subseries, components of subseries may be files, and components of files may be items. A component may be either an unnumbered <gi>c</gi> or a numbered <gi>c01</gi>, <gi>c02</gi>, etc.
                     Numbered and un-numbered components cannot be mixed in an EAD instance, and only up to twelve numbered <gi>c</gi>s, (<gi>c01</gi>-<gi>c12</gi>) may be used in an EAD instance. Numbering components
                     may assist a finding aid encoder in accurately nesting components.</p>

                     <gi>container</gi> contributes to locating the described materials by indicating the kinds of containers that physically hold the materials and identifying any sequential numbers assigned to those
                     containers. <gi>container</gi> is used most frequently at the component level. This storage information can help researchers understand how extensive the described material is, especially in the
                     absence of a specific <gi>physdescstructured</gi> or <gi>physdesc</gi> statement at the component level.</p>
                  <p>Consistency in the use of <gi>container</gi> and its attributes is essential to enabling a style sheet to properly display the information, which often consists of a tabular listing of archival
                     materials and their associated boxes, folders, etc. For example, &lt;container localtype="Box"&gt; is not necessarily the same as &lt;container localtype="box"&gt; to a style sheet. Also keep in mind
                     that a style sheet may automatically display column headings based on the <att>localtype</att> value. It is important to establish one method of expressing values in <att>localtype</att> and be
                     consistent within and across your institution's finding aids.</p>

                        <gi>repository</gi>, and <gi>abstract</gi>. <gi>unitid</gi> and <gi>physloc</gi> are suggested if applicable to a repository's practice. <gi>did</gi> within components can have fewer elements, and
                     might have only <gi>container</gi> or <gi>unitid</gi> and <gi>unittitle</gi>.</p>

                  <p>Use <gi>dsc</gi> to wrap subordinate components in the archival hierarchy of the materials being described. Although <gi>dsc</gi> may repeat, it is recommended to include only a single <gi>dsc</gi>
                     element. Because it is a wrapper element and not an essential part of archival description, <gi>dsc</gi> may be deprecated in future versions of EAD. Avoiding multiple <gi>dsc</gi> elements within an
                     EAD instance will make future migrations simpler. </p>
                  <p>The subordinate components can be presented in several different forms or levels of descriptive detail, which are identified by the element's optional <att>dsctype</att>. For example, "combined" is
                     used when the narrative description of a series is followed immediately by a listing of the contents of that series within a single <gi>dsc</gi>. The <att>dsctype</att> value "analyticover"
                     identifies an overview description of series and subseries, which might be followed by a second <gi>dsc</gi> with the <att>dsctype</att> set to "in-depth" that provides a more detailed listing of the
                     content of the materials, including information about the container numbers associated with those materials. The <att>dsctype</att> "otherdsctype" is for models that do not follow any of the
                     above-mentioned formats, in which case <att>otherdsctype</att> can then be used to specify a particular presentation model.</p>
                  <p>If <gi>dsc</gi> contains children other than <gi>thead</gi> or component elements (<gi>c</gi>, <gi>cXX</gi>), those elements must come first, followed by the optional <gi>thead</gi>, then <gi>c</gi>

                           written on the versos). Corporate names appear in direct order; personal names in
                           inverted order (i.e., filed by surname). Rectos and versos of photographs were
                           microfilmed to capture information exactly as it appears on the photographs. To
                           locate a specific photographer/studio, a user should consider all possible forms of
                           entry (corporate and personal), browse the index under these forms, identify which
                           LOT(s) contain photographs by that photographer/studio, then browse the relevant LOT
                           on the microfilm to locate specific photographs that bear the markings of the
                           specific photographer/studio.</ead:p>

                     <gi>odd</gi> may be useful in converting legacy finding aids to the EAD format, by designating as "other" information that does not easily map to a more specific element. <gi>odd</gi> may be used
                     when information about the described materials does not correspond to another element’s definition, when the information is heterogeneous enough to make a single classification difficult, and when
                     shifting the information to permit more specific content designation would be too costly or burdensome.</p>
                  <p>Use <gi>odd</gi> only after considering how the existence of unspecified content will affect search, retrieval, and display.</p>

                     <gi>physdescset</gi> binds together two or more <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements. A set of <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements may relate in one of two ways: they may be parallel to each other
                     or they may describe disparate parts that together represent the whole or part of the material described.</p>
                  <p>For example, a <gi>physdescset</gi> with @parallel="true" might bind a <gi>physdescstructured</gi> element with @physdescstructuredtype="carrier" and a <gi>physdescstructured</gi> element with
                     @physdescstructuredtype="spaceoccupied," indicating that the two <gi>physdescstrutured</gi> elements describe the same materials in different ways and are therefore parallel statements of extent.
                     @parallel="true" denotes that <gi>physdescset</gi> and its child <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements share the same <att>coverage</att> value, i.e., a statement of extent for part of the materials
                     described cannot be parallel to a statement of extent for the whole of the materials described.</p>
                  <p>Alternately, a <gi>physdescset</gi> with @parallel="false" may combine two or more <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements that do not describe the same materials. @parallel="false" denotes that
                        <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements that comprise the set all share @coverage="part" (two or more extent statements with @coverage="whole" are by definition parallel). </p>
                  <p>A <gi>physdescset</gi> with @parallel="false" and @coverage="whole" indicates multiple statements of extent that in sum represent the whole of the materials being described. </p>
                  <p>A <gi>physdescset</gi> with @parallel="false" and @coverage="part" indicates multiple statements of extent that in sum represent a part of the materials being described.</p>
                  <p>It is not necessary to bind multiple <gi>physdescstructured</gi> elements within <gi>physdescset</gi>. Only do so when you need to convey the relationships indicated by <att>parallel</att> and

                     <gi>repository</gi> records the name of the institution or agency, family, or individual responsible for providing intellectual access to the materials being described. <gi>corpname</gi>,
                        <gi>famname</gi>, <gi>name</gi>, or <gi>persname</gi> must be used within <gi>repository</gi> to encode the proper name. This may be followed by an optional <gi>address</gi> to provide contact
                     information for the repository.</p>
                  <p>Although the repository providing intellectual access usually also has physical custody over the materials, this is not always the case. For example, an archives may assume responsibility for
                     long-term intellectual access to electronic records, but the actual electronic data files or systems may continue to reside in the office where they were created and maintained, or they may be held
                     for long-term storage by a unit such as a data library that is able to provide the appropriate technical facilities for storage and remounting.</p>
                  <p>When it is clear that the physical custodian does not provide intellectual access, use <gi>physloc</gi> to identify the custodian and <gi>repository</gi> to designate the intellectual caretaker. When
                     a distinction cannot be made, assume that the custodian of the physical objects also provides intellectual access to them and should be recognized as the <gi>repository</gi>.</p>

            <head>Appendix B : Deprecated and Obsolete Elements and Attributes</head>
            <p>The revision of EAD 1.0 to EAD 2002 established a precedent that elements to be removed from EAD would first be deprecated – suppressed but available if necessary – before being removed from subsequent
               versions. All elements deprecated in EAD 2002 were removed from EAD3. Elements present in the DTD version of EAD 2002 but removed from the schema versions of EAD 2002 (<gi>archdescgrp</gi>,
               <gi>dscgrp</gi>, and <gi>eadgrp</gi>) were also removed from EAD3.</p>
            <p>The Society of American Archivists' Technical Subcommittee on EAD (TS-EAD) endeavored to honor the commitment to deprecate removed elements.However, the extent of the changes in EAD3 made comprehensive
               deprecation impossible. Elements to be removed entirely from the standard remain available in undeprecated versions of EAD3. Elements that were replaced by other elements offering commensurate
               functionality, or whose availability within the standard changed are in most cases not supported in undeprecated EAD3.</p>
            <p>The following attributes and elements are not available in the default versions of EAD3 (ead3.rng, ead3.xsd, and ead3.dtd), but are available in the undeprecated versions (ead3_undeprecated.rng,
               ead3_undeprecated.xsd, and ead3_undeprecated.dtd). Definitions for these attributes and elements follow below.</p>

               The undeprecated <gi>physdesc</gi> includes <gi>extent</gi>, <gi>dimensions</gi>, <gi>physfacet</gi>, and the access point elements (e.g. <gi>genreform</gi>) whereas the default <gi>physdesc</gi> in EAD3
               does not. The undeprecated <gi>unittitle</gi> includes <gi>bibseries</gi>,<gi>imprint</gi>, <gi>edition</gi>, and <gi>unitdate</gi>, whereas the default <gi>unittitle</gi> in EAD3 does not.</p>
            <p>Style sheets for migrating EAD 2002 to EAD3 will include an option to preserve deprecated elements. However, when future versions of EAD are released, support for elements and attributes deprecated in EAD3
               will be removed and their forward migration will not be supported.</p>
            <p>The following obsolete attributes and elements were removed entirely in EAD3. Their semantics or functionality were replaced by new attributes or elements.</p>

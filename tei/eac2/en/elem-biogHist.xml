                     dates and date ranges with associated events and/or places. The
                        <gi>abstract</gi> element is intended to provide a very brief synopsis of
                     the full <gi>biogHist</gi> content that could be extracted for inclusion in a

                     expressing or representing the biography or history of the CPF entity. A
                     simpler discursive expression of the information may be encoded as one or more
                        <gi>p</gi> elements. The optional <gi>head</gi> element can be used to add a
                     title or caption to the text.</p>

                           1970-78. She developed new methods of teaching based on the recognition

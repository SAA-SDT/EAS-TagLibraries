                        <eac:p>Sir Edward Noel (d 1643) married Julian, daughter and co-heir of
                           Baptists Hicks (d 1629), Viscount Campden, and succeeded to the viscouty
                           of Campden and a portion of his father-in-law's estates. The third
                           Viscount Campden (1612-82) married Hester Wotton, daughter of the second
                           Baron Wotton. The fourth Viscount Campden (1641-1689, created Earl of
                           Gainsborough, 1682) married Elizabeth Wriothesley, elder daughter of the
                           fourth Earl of Southampton. Jane Noel (d 1811), sister of the fifth and
                           sixth Earls of Gainsborough, married Gerard Anne Edwards of Welham Grove
                           (Leicetershire) and had issue Gerard Noel Edwards (1759-1838). He married
                           in 1780 Diana Middleton (1762-1823 suo jure Baroness Barham), daughter of
                           Charles Middleton (1726-1813), created first Baronet of Barham Court
                           (Kent) in 1781 and first Baron Barham in 1805. GN Edwards assumed the
                           surname Noel in 1798 on inheriting the sixth Earl of Gainborough's
                           Rutland and Gloucestershire estates (though not the Earl's honours, which
                           were extinguished); and he later inherited his father-in-law's baronetcy.
                           His eldest son John Noel (1781-1866) succeeded to the estates of his
                           mother and his father, to his mother's barony and his father's baronetcy,
                           and was created Viscount Campden and Earl of Gainsborough in
                           1841.</eac:p>
